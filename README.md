My website displays currency exchange rates (historical and current) for your home country and a destination country. It then copares the rates to determine if it is favorable from a currency exchange rate perspective to travel to this country, essentially doing "currency arbitrage" for you. It also has a multi-country compare to see which countries might be the best. The app uses the REST Countries API to collect basic flag and currency info about the target country. It then uses CurrencyAPI to pull rates and display the needed info. The API key can be accessed autmatically because the app is hosted via streamlit, which has a secrets function to store api keys.
